In this project, we looked at specific details of startup companies ­­­­in order to help rising
entrepreneurs better understand what attributes make a company more statistically successful.
The information is mainly about the inner workings of startup companies. Although this could
be a very useful tool for people looking to create their own startup, the hope is that
anyone who is interested in learning about startups would be able to easily use our service
to discover what they want to know. We are working with the 2013 Snapshot dataset from _Crunchbase_.
_Crunchbase_ is a part of the online tech company TechCrunch. They specifically deal with information
regarding investors, startups, and capital firms. We are mostly analyzing the startup
portion of the information, although combined with investor information, we were able to create a
very dynamic set of information.

In this analysis, we have decided to focus on certain strong points within companies’ development.
These are the fields that we found to be most critical to the development of a company’s success
after evaluating the data:

- Founder Education Levels
  - It is common knowledge that people like
- Company Relationships
  - adsfasd
- Funding Levels/Participants
  - adsfa sd
- IPO Status
  - alsdkfj
