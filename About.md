In this project, we looked at specific details of startup companies ­­­­in order to help rising
entrepreneurs better understand what attributes make a company more statistically successful.
The information is mainly about the inner workings of startup companies. Although this could
be a very useful tool for people looking to create their own startup, the hope is that
anyone who is interested in learning about startups would be able to easily use our service
to discover what they want to know. We are working with the 2013 Snapshot dataset from _Crunchbase_.
_Crunchbase_ is a part of the online tech company TechCrunch. They specifically deal with information
regarding investors, startups, and capital firms. We are mostly analyzing the startup
portion of the information, although combined with investor information, we were able to create a
very dynamic set of information.

In this analysis, we have decided to focus on certain strong points within companies’ development.
These are the fields that we found to be most critical to the development of a company’s success
after evaluating the data:

- **Founder Education Levels**
  - It is common knowledge that successful people such as Steve Jobs, and Bill Gates dropped out
  of school to start their companies. However, this does not mean that every successful company's
  founder dropped out in order to start it. Thus, we thought that this could be an important
  statistic to look at, and even more so, to communicate to new entrepreneurs. These results can be
  seen under the degrees tab of the report.
- **Company Relationships**
  - One thing that can cause a company that is on the edge of failure to make it one more round is
  having connections. Up and coming companies often need connections in order to succeed. This can
  be seen on the relationships tab.
- **Funding Levels/Participants**
  - Further completion of funding rounds typically is a very good tell tale sign of a successful
  company. Generally speaking, companies that surpass the "C" level of funding are more likely
  to be successful. That being said, there are obviously other factors that play into success
  as well. In this report, we have compared different levels of funding with companies that have
  lots of relationships with other corporations. The results can be seen under the relationships tab.  
- **IPO Status**
  - Not all successful companies IPO. That being said, almost all companies that IPO are quite successful,
  since there needs to be some level of success before a company can IPO. With that in mind, our report looks
  closely at attributes of companies that have IPOed, and tries to find what aspects are common among
  companies that have IPOed, therefore supporting their claim to success.
